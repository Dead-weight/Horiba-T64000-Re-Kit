# Horiba-T64000-Re-Kit

For optimization purposes, the optical components between the microscope head-stock
and the spectrometer necessitated modest redesign for a Horiba T64000 Raman spectroscopy unit. To this end, 
a custom-fit optical breadboard was manufactured to realize the design elements. 
An important feature in this re-design is the improved throughput and control over
the spatial filtering for the single-spectrometer setting. Configuration schematics for the single and triple spec
settings are located below and the models for the breadboard and 3D prints for the sample holder are located in the files.
